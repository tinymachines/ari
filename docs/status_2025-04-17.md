# ARI Project Status Report: 2025-04-17

## Current Status

The AWS Resource Inventory (ARI) project has reached its initial release milestone with the following components completed:

### Core Functionality
- ✅ AWS resource inventory collection for major services (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB)
- ✅ AWS CLI service mapper for discovering and documenting AWS commands
- ✅ SQLite database storage with resource, cost, and command mapping tables
- ✅ Basic cost data integration with AWS Cost Explorer

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Proper Python package structure with pip installation support
- ✅ Project documentation (README, USAGE guides)
- ✅ Git repository setup and initial commit
- ✅ Terminal wrapper with colorful menu interface for AWS profile selection
- ✅ Fixed database schema for proper UNIQUE constraints

## Known Issues

1. **SQLite Schema**: Fixed an issue with ON CONFLICT clauses not matching UNIQUE constraints
2. **AWS Credentials**: Currently supports ~/.aws/credentials file format, but doesn't handle AWS SSO or environment variables yet
3. **Resource Coverage**: Only supports 5 major AWS services so far, with many more to implement
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling in place, but needs improvement for API rate limiting and throttling

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
1. **Add More AWS Services**:
   - CloudFront
   - ECS/EKS
   - ElastiCache
   - API Gateway
   - Redshift

2. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Set up pytest framework
   - Add unit tests for core functions
   - Create mock AWS responses for testing

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for testing and linting
   - Implement automated versioning
   - Set up PyPI publishing

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)
1. **Enhanced Authentication**:
   - Support for AWS SSO
   - Support for environment variables
   - Integration with AWS credentials helper tools

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Basic reporting capabilities
   - Cost optimization suggestions
   - Resource usage patterns

3. **Resource Tags Analysis**:
   - Identify resources without required tags
   - Suggest standardized tagging strategies
   - Generate compliance reports

### Long-term Vision
1. **Web Interface**:
   - Develop a Flask/FastAPI web dashboard
   - Interactive visualizations for resource relationships
   - Cost analysis charts and projections

2. **Advanced Cost Management**:
   - Predictive cost analysis
   - Resource rightsizing recommendations
   - Budget alerts and anomaly detection

3. **Multi-Account Management**:
   - Support for organizations with multiple AWS accounts
   - Cross-account resource dependencies
   - Consolidated reporting

## Resources Needed
- AWS account with wider permissions for adding support for additional services
- Time allocation for implementing test coverage
- Feedback from early users on most valuable services to add next

## Technical Debt
- Refine error handling for AWS API rate limiting
- Improve code modularity for easier extension of supported services
- Optimize database schema for better performance with large inventories

## Conclusion
The ARI project has a solid foundation with its initial implementation, packaging, and documentation. The focus now should be on expanding service coverage, improving test infrastructure, and setting up continuous integration.
